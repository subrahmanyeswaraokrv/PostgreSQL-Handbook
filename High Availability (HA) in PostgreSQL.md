High Availability (HA) in PostgreSQL ensures minimal downtime and data loss in case of failures. 
Below are the main high availability options in PostgreSQL, 
ranging from simple replication to advanced failover management and clustering:
=====================================================================================================================
üöÄ PostgreSQL High Availability Options
1. Streaming Replication + Manual Failover
Description: Primary sends WAL (Write-Ahead Log) changes to standby servers in real-time.

Failover: Manual; requires promotion of a standby using pg_ctl promote.

Use Case: Small setups or internal systems where occasional manual intervention is acceptable.

Pros: Simple to configure.

Cons: No automatic failover.

2. Streaming Replication + Replication Manager (repmgr)
Tool: repmgr

Features:

Automated failover.

Node monitoring.

CLI for switchover and promotion.

Architecture: Master-slave replication with health checks.

Pros: Reliable and widely used.

Cons: External tool; requires daemon (repmgrd) and shared SSH trust between nodes.

3. Patroni + etcd/Consul/Zookeeper
Tool: Patroni

Architecture: Uses distributed consensus via etcd/Consul to maintain cluster state.

Features:

Automatic failover.

Leader election.

REST API for health and control.

Integration with HAProxy or PgBouncer for service discovery.

Pros: Production-grade; cloud-native.

Cons: Requires additional components (etcd/Consul).

4. Pgpool-II
Tool: Pgpool-II

Features:

Connection pooling.

Load balancing (read-only replicas).

Automated failover (with watchdog).

Architecture: Sits between client and PostgreSQL.

Pros: Multipurpose (HA, load balancing, connection pooling).

Cons: Complex to configure for HA mode.

5. PgBouncer + Custom Failover Scripts
Tool: PgBouncer

Use: Lightweight connection pooler.

HA Use Case: Works with scripts to switch primary/standby.

Pros: Lightweight; good for scale-out.

Cons: Needs integration with monitoring/failover mechanism.

6. Kubernetes-native HA with Patroni or CrunchyData
Platform: Kubernetes

Tools:

Patroni + K8s StatefulSets

Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator

Features:

Self-healing.

Auto-scaling.

Auto-failover.

Pros: Best for cloud-native apps.

Cons: Requires Kubernetes expertise.

7. Cloud-native PostgreSQL HA (AWS/GCP/Azure)
Options:

Amazon RDS / Aurora PostgreSQL ‚Äì Managed HA with multi-AZ.

Google Cloud SQL ‚Äì High availability configurations.

Azure Database for PostgreSQL ‚Äì Zone-redundant HA setups.

Pros: No ops overhead; automatic failover.

Cons: Vendor lock-in; limited tuning.

8. BDR (Bi-Directional Replication)
Tool: BDR by 2ndQuadrant

Use Case: Multi-master replication.

Pros: Active-active HA.

Cons: Complex, commercial licensing for full features.
